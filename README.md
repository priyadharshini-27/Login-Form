Better react forms with formik

<b>Formik</b>
      <p>Jared Palmer authored the Formik library out of frustration when building React forms. He needed a way to standardize the input components and the flow of form submission. Formik helps you to write the three most annoying parts of building a form:

    Getting values in and out of form state
    Validation and error messages
    Handling form submission
